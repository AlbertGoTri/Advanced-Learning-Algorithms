# 🧠 Advanced Learning Algorithms

Welcome to my repository for the Coursera course [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms) by **Andrew Ng**, offered through **DeepLearning.AI**.

This course is the second in the Machine Learning Specialization, and it builds upon the foundations of supervised learning. You'll find my completed assignments and labs organized by week.
